AWS services typically used in building a web application, specifically for a serverless architecture:

AWS Lambda:

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. In the context of a web application, you can use AWS Lambda to create the backend logic for your APIs, handle requests, and execute business logic. You can trigger Lambda functions in response to API Gateway requests, events from other AWS services, or on a schedule. Amazon API Gateway:

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that makes it easy to create, publish, and manage APIs. It provides features like request/response transformation, rate limiting, authentication, and security for your APIs. You can integrate API Gateway with Lambda functions to create RESTful or WebSocket APIs for your web application. AWS Amplify:

AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services that helps frontend developers build full-stack serverless web and mobile applications. It simplifies the integration of AWS services, including authentication, storage, and APIs, into your application. Amplify offers a CLI for quickly setting up authentication, GraphQL API, and storage services. Amazon DynamoDB:

Amazon DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and scalable storage. It's suitable for storing structured data and is often used as the backend data store for web applications. DynamoDB is highly available and can automatically scale to handle varying workloads. In a typical scenario, you would set up your web application as follows:

Use AWS Lambda functions to handle API requests, process data, and interact with your database. Create RESTful or GraphQL APIs in Amazon API Gateway to expose your Lambda functions. Use AWS Amplify to simplify frontend development and easily connect to your backend services, including authentication, API calls, and data storage. Store application data in Amazon DynamoDB, which is a NoSQL database designed for fast and scalable access. This architecture allows you to build a serverless web application with minimal infrastructure management, automatic scaling, and cost-efficiency. You can focus on developing your application logic while AWS handles the operational aspects of your infrastructure.
